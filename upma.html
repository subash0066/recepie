        <p><strong>Step 1:</strong>   Prep the ingredients first to make upma recipe. Take 1 cup rava (fine variety) and set it aside. Next gather the aromatics, lentils, nuts, spices and herbs ready. You will need:</p>
        <p><strong>Step 2:</strong>   Heat a pan or kadai first. Add 1 cup rava or cream of wheat (fine variety).</p>
        <p><strong>Step 3:</strong>   Begin to roast the rava. Stir often while roasting the rava.</p>
        <p><strong>Step 4:</strong>   The rava or sooji grains should become fragrant and start to look dry, separate and crisp. Dont brown the rava.</p>
        <p><strong>Step 5:</strong>    Once the rava becomes fragrant and starts to look dry and crisp, switch off the flame and put the roasted rava on a plate and set aside.</p>
        <p><strong>Step 6:</strong>    In a pan, heat 2 tablespoons ghee (clarified butter) or oil. You could use sunflower oil or peanut oil or safflower oil or any neutral tasting oil.</p>
        <p><strong>Step 7:</strong>    Lower the heat. Add 1 teaspoon mustard seeds. When you hear the crackling sound of mustard seeds, it means they are getting fried.</p>
        <p><strong>Step 8:</strong>    Now add the ½ teaspoon cumin seeds along with 1 teaspoon chana dal (husked and split bengal gram) and 1 teaspoon urad dal (husked and split black gram).</p>
        <p><strong>Step 9:</strong>     Stirring often fry until the chana dal and urad dal begin to brown a bit.</p>
        <p><strong>Step 10:</strong>     Immediately add 10 to 12 cashews and begin to fry on a low to medium-low heat.</p>
        <p><strong>Step 11:</strong>     By the time the cashews get golden the dals should also be golden.</p>
        <p><strong>Step 12:</strong>    Now add the finely chopped onions.</p>
        <p><strong>Step 13:</strong>     Sauté the onions until they soften and become translucent on a low to medium-low heat.</p>
        <p><strong>Step 14:</strong>     Then add the chopped green chillies, ginger and curry leaves. You can also add 1 dried red chilli at this step.</p>
        <p><strong>Step 15:</strong>      Mix well & sauté for a few seconds.</p>
        <p><strong>Step 16:</strong>      Then add 2.5 cups water to this mixture.</p>
        <p><strong>Step 17:</strong>       Add salt as required. Mix well and check the taste of water. It should be a bit salty but not too much.

            In case if the salt becomes less in the dish, you can always sprinkle some salt from the top when eating.</p>
        <p><strong>Step 18:</strong>      Then add 1 teaspoon sugar. Sugar is optional and you can skip it. We prefer a slight sweet taste in the upma and hence we add it.</p>
        <p><strong>Step 19:</strong>      Stir again. On a medium to high flame, heat the water and let it come to a rolling boiling.</p>
        <p><strong>Step 20:</strong>       When the water comes to a rolling boil, lower the flame to its lowest. Then add the rava in 4 to 5 batches with a spoon.</p>
        <p><strong>Step 21:</strong>        Once you add the first batch of rava, stir and mix immediately so that the roasted rava gets mixed evenly with the water.</p>
        <p><strong>Step 22:</strong>        Then add the next batch of rava. Mix and stir again very well ensuring that the batch of rava is mixed evenly in water.</p>
        <p><strong>Step 23:</strong>         Serve upma hot or warm with slices of lemon or a side of lemon pickle or coconut chutney. You can opt to drizzle half to one teaspoon of ghee while serving. If you like you can garnish with some coriander leaves.

            I also sprinkle some sev (fried gram flour vermicelli) on upma while serving. Though this is not the way upma is traditionally served, the folks at home prefer this Mumbai style. You can also serve it with idli podi.</p>
